GoogleOauth
-----------
Facade / manager for the whole token management process against Google's REST API. Manual login / grant code handling required at the moment, see https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2?hl=de&csw=1 (this tool works with "Installed application" setup due to various reasons).

The index.php is just a dummy dispatcher as stated in the comments, go down src/ for the real deal.
